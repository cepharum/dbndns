# djbdns / dbndns

This repository has been started to keep djbdns and its fork dbndns available for us. We currently don't intend to maintain this code except for trying to have a more convenient source for creating docker containers running latest version possible. The repository has been started with djbdns-1.05 and latest set of patches provided by Debian project.
