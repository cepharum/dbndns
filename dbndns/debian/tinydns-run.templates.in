Type: string
Default: 127.0.0.1
Description: IP address of the tinydns DNS service:
 Specify the IP address for the tinydns DNS service.
 .
 The IP address must be configured on this computer.  The IP address
 must not have a DNS cache or any other port-53 service.  One computer
 can run a DNS server alongside a DNS cache as long as they are on
 separate IP addresses.  The standard setup for small networks is to
 put a DNS cache on a private address such as 127.0.0.1 or 10.53.0.1,
 and a DNS server on a public address.
